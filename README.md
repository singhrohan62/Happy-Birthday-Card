# Happy-Birthday-Card
A simple android app containing a birthday card. This repository was created for learning purpose.
The only purpose of creating the repository was to understand the basics of an Android application 
and understand its UI-implementation.
This repository contains only the src code for the android application ie, the MainActivity.java 
file and content_main.xml files. If interested, you can view the src code and bring out the changes 
if you want to make a birthday card!
